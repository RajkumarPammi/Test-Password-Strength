# Test-Password-Strength
We'll use React for the frontend and implement a robust algorithm to assess password strength. Let's break this down into steps and create a user-friendly interface with real-time feedback.

Let's start by creating the main component for our password strength tester:

```typescriptreact project="PasswordStrengthTester"
...
```

This implementation creates a password strength tester with the following features:

1. Real-time password strength calculation
2. Visual representation of password strength using a color-coded progress bar
3. Textual feedback on password strength (Weak, Fair, Good, Strong)
4. Suggestions for improving password strength


The password strength is calculated based on the following criteria:

- Length (minimum 8 characters)
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of numbers
- Presence of special characters


The tool provides a score from 0 to 100 and offers specific feedback on how to improve the password strength.

To further enhance this project, you could consider adding the following features:

1. Password generation suggestions
2. Check against common password lists
3. Estimated time to crack the password
4. Ability to toggle password visibility
5. Animations for a more engaging user experience
